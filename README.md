# mRNA_sequencer
Fun little terminal app that takes any viable mature mRNA sequence and returns the location of the start & stop codons, along with the specific amino acids in between.

Example mRNA sequences(copy and paste one of these into your terminal when prompted):

#1 AUCCGAACAUGAAAAGAGCAAUAUUCAACUAAGCUACC

#2 ACUUCGGACAUGAAUCCGCAGGCAUGACCGACU

#3 GGGCAUGAUCGUUGCCGAUGAAGGAAGACUCCCCCAUCAACGGUGGUAAAAUG
